            High Tension (HT) and Low Tension (LT) panels play a critical role
            in ensuring the safe and efficient management of electrical power
            across various industries and applications. HT panels are designed
            for high-voltage systems, serving as the backbone for power
            distribution in large-scale operations. On the other hand, LT panels
            handle lower voltage distributions, making them essential for
            residential complexes, commercial buildings, and industrial
            facilities.
