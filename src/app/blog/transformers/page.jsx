            Transformers are critical components in electrical systems,
            facilitating the safe and efficient transfer of electrical energy
            across different voltage levels. By stepping up or stepping down the
            voltage, transformers ensure that power is delivered effectively to
            various applications, including residential, commercial, and
            industrial setups. They are fundamental to maintaining power
            stability and reliability, which are crucial for the smooth
            operation of businesses and industries.
